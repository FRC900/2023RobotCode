/* Original Author: Dave Coleman
   Desc:   Example ros_control hardware interface blank template for the FRCRobot
           For a more detailed simulation example, see sim_hw_interface.cpp

	The hardware interface code reads and writes directly from/to hardware
	connected to the RoboRIO. This include DIO, Analog In, pneumatics,
	and CAN Talons, among other things.

	The two main methods are read() and write().

	read() is responsible for reading hardware state and filling in
	a buffered copy of it. This buffered copy of the hardware state
	can be accessed by various controllers to figure out what to do next.

	write() does the opposite. It takes commands that have been buffered
	by various controllers and sends them to the hardware.  The design goal
	here is to minimize redundant writes to the HW.  Previous values written
	are cached, and subsequent writes of the same value are skipped.

	The main read loop actually reads from all hardware except CAN Talons.
	The CAN talon status reads are double buffered. A thread is kicked
	off for each CAN talon.  That thread updates a buffer which is shared
	by the main read loop. The only thing the main read loop does is
	consolidate the data from each thread into a separate state buffer,
	this one externally visible to controllers.  Since reads are the slowest
	part of the process, this decouples hardware read speed from the
	control loop update rate.

	The PDP data also works in a similar way.  There is a thread running
	at a constant rate polling PDP data, and read() picks up the latest
	copy of that data each time through the read/update/write loop

//        set output state var from command in write() on jetson - this will be reflected in joint_states
//          but do not call Set since hardware doesn't exist (local write)
//
//      on rio (local update = false, local hardware = true
//         don't do anything in read
//         update loop needs to read joint_states using joint state listener
//             this writes values from the jetson to each local joint command on the Rio
//         write() sets hardware from those joint commands, and also sets state
//            write needs to set value as - is, don't apply invert,
//            since it was already applied on the remote side
//
//	local_update = true, local hardware = true -> no listener
//
//		This would be for hardware on the Rio which is also modified by controllers running on the Rio
//
//	local_update = false, local hardware = true -> listener to transfer cmd from remote to local
//
//		E.g. config on the Rio if a controller on the Jetson wanted to update hardware on the Rio
//
//	local_update = true, local_hardware = false -> no listener, update local state but don't write to hw
//
//		e.g. config on the Jetson if a controller on the Jetson wanted to update hardware on the rio
//
//	local_update = false, local_hardware = false -> listener to mirror updated state from local?
//
//		nothing is happening on the controller wrt the hardware other than wanting to keep current on status
//		not sure how useful this might be, except in cases like digital in where update==hardware
//		by definition
//
//	So !local_update implies add to remote Interface to run a listener
//
// For analog & digital input and state like PDP, match, joystick, etc, there's only 1 local flag.
// The only cases which make sense are local_update = local_hardware, since the value can only be
// updated by reading the hardware itself.  There, just use a "local" flag.
