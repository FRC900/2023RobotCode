# Given a rosbag in sys.argv[1], this script will analyze the time between the align and shoot goal being sent 
# and the note leaving the shooter (preshooter switch going from 1 to 0). This time will also be broken down into:
# - time between align goal being sent and align goal being done
# - time between align goal being done and shooting goal being sent
# - time between pivot goal being sent and pivot goal being done
# - time between shooter goal being sent and shooter being up to speed
# - time between shooter being up to speed (done waiting for pivot and shooter) and note leaving the shooter
