x, y of where wheel touches ramp
velocity -> convert to radians per second, should be a constant conversion
v / R # of rotations per second
circumference of wheel = 2 * pi * R
angle of ramp = 31.5 degrees
length of robot = const
timestep = 
distance_between_wheels = const


Process:
timestep * rotations/second = rotations 
circumference * rotations = distance traveled on ramp = hypot
y_diff = hypot * sin(angle of ramp)
x_diff = hypot * cos(angle of ramp)
x_new = x + x_diff
y_new = y + y_diff

# calculate new angle
sin^-1(y_new / distance_between_wheels) = new angle

x1_new = x_new - sqrt(w^2 - y_new^2)
y1_new = 0




--------------------

v / R = rotations/second
circumference of wheel = 2 * pi * R
x1_new = rotations/second * dT * circumference
y1_new = 0
