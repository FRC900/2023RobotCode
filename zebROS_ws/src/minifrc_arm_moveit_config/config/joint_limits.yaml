# joint_limits.yaml allows the dynamics properties specified in the URDF to be overwritten or augmented as needed

# For beginners, we downscale velocity and acceleration limits.
# You can always specify higher scaling factors (<= 1.0) in your motion requests.  # Increase the values below to 1.0 to always move at maximum speed.

# Specific joint properties can be changed with the keys [max_position, min_position, max_velocity, max_acceleration]
# Joint limits can be turned off with [has_velocity_limits, has_acceleration_limits]
